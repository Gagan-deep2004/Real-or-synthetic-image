# Real-or-synthetic-image
Classify image ie either it is real or synthetic/artificial.

This project is a Google Colab-based image classifier that distinguishes between **real** and **artificial (synthetic)** images using the Kaggle Cifake dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images).

This project uses a CNN built on top of a pre-trained ResNet50 model to classify images.

## Model Architecture
- Base Model: `ResNet50` (pre-trained on ImageNet)
  - `include_top=False` to exclude the original classifier
  - `input_shape=(32, 32, 3)` *(Note: Can be improved by resizing to 224×224)*
- Custom Head:
  - `Flatten()` layer
  - `Dense(256, relu)` + `BatchNormalization` + `Dropout(0.5)`
  - `Dense(128, relu)`
  - Final `Dense(1, sigmoid)` for binary classification
 
## Training Setup
-Optimizer: Adam with learning rate `0.001`
- Learning Rate Scheduler:
  - Custom scheduler reducing LR by 5% each epoch
  - `LearningRateScheduler` callback
- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
- Callbacks:
  - `EarlyStopping` (optional, recommended)
  - `ReduceLROnPlateau` (optional, recommended)
- Epochs: Typically trained for 20–30 epochs
- 
## Data
Dataset: 
  - 50,000 real CIFAR-10 images
  - 50,000 fake (generated by StyleGAN2)
  - Input size: 32×32 (original); can be resized for better feature extraction
  - Split:
  - 70% Training
  - 20% Validation
  - 10% Testing
